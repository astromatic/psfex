Installing the software
***********************

Hardware requirements
=====================

PSFEx runs in (ANSI) text-mode from a shell. A window system is
not necessary for basic operation.

When it comes to memory usage, the amount required by PSFEx
depends mostly on the number of point sources present in the input
catalogues times the number of pixels in the small image that
represents each of them. A typical figure is about 15 kbytes per point
source; hence even on a modest computer with 1GB of memory, more than
20,000 point sources can easily be accommodated at once.

Note that PSFEx takes advantage of multiple CPU cores for some operations.


Obtaining PSFEx
===============

For Linux users, the simplest way to have PSFEx up and running is
to install the standard binary package the comes with your Linux
distribution. Run, e.g., "apt-get psfex" (on Debian) or "dnf install psfex"
(Fedora) and PSFEx, as well as all its dependencies, will
automatically be installed. If you decided to install the package this
way you may skip the following and move straight to the next section.

However if PSFEx is not available in your distribution, or to
obtain the most recent version, the PSFEx source package can be
downloaded from the official GitHub repository . One may choose one of
the stable releases, or for the fearless, a copy of the current master
development branch.


Software requirements
=====================

PSFEx has been developed on GNU/Linux machines and should compile
on any POSIX-compliant system (this includes Apple OS X and Cygwin
on Microsoft Windows, at the price of some difficulties with the
configuration), provided that the development packages of the
following libraries have been installed:

* ATLAS V3.6 and above [2],

* FFTw V3.0 and above [3],

* PLPlot V5.9 and above.

On Fedora/Redhat distributions for instance, the development packages
above are available as "atlas-devel", "fftw-devel" and "plplot-devel".
PLPlot is only required for producing diagnostic plots. Note that
ATLAS and FFTw are not necessary if PSFEx is linked with
Intel's MKL (Math Kernel Library) library.


Installation
============

To install from the GitHub source package, you must first uncompress
the archive:

   $ unzip psfex-<version>.zip

A new directory called "psfex-<version>" should now appear at the
current location on your disk. Enter the directory and generate the
files required by the autotools, which the package relies on:

   $ cd psfex-<version>
   $ sh autogen.sh

A "configure" script is created. This script has many options, which
may be listed with the "--help" option:

   $ ./configure --help

No options are required for compiling with the default GNU C compiler
("gcc") if all the required libraries are installed at their default
locations:

   $ ./configure

Compared to "gcc" and the librairies above, the combination of the
Intel compiler ("icc") and the MKL (Math Kernel Library) libraries
can give the PSFEx executable a strong boost in performance,
thanks to better vectorized code. If "icc" and the MKL (Math Kernel
Library) are installed on your system [4] , you can take advantage of
those using instead

   $ ./configure --enable-mkl

Additionally, if the PSFEx binary is to be run on a different
machine that does not have "icc" and the MKL (Math Kernel Library)
installed (e.g., a cluster computing node), you must configure a
partially statically linked executable using

   $ ./configure --enable-mkl --enable-auto-flags --enable-best-link

In all cases, PSFEx can now be compiled with

   $ make -j

An "src/psfex" executable is created. For system-wide installation,
run the usual

   $ sudo make install

You may now check that the software is properly installed by simply
typing in your shell:

   $ psfex

(note that some shells require the "rehash" command to be run before
making a freshly installed executable accessible in the execution
path).

[1] Mac OS X ".dmg" packages should be available soon.

[2] Use the "--with-atlas" and/or "--with-atlas-incdir" options of
    the PSFEx "configure" script to specify the ATLAS library and
    include paths if ATLAS files are installed at unusual locations.

[3] Make sure that FFTw has been compiled with "configure"
    options "--enable-threads --enable-float".

[4] The Linux versions of the Intel compiler and MKL (Math
    Kernel Library) are available for free to academic researchers,
    students, educators and open source contributors.
